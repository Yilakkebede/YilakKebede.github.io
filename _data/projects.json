		# My Storry
		Hi, I am `Yilak Kebede`, a *Data Analyst*,*Researcher*, and a *Technology Enthusiast* from Toronto, Canada, where I found people like me who want to talk about various type of data, share data-driven business analysis and partnering with each other to solve problems. I like teamwork and I believe When you have the right data, being analyzed by great people, you end up with amazing results.

I was born in Addis, Ethiopia and traveled to China, Japan, Germany, Italy, and the United States for my masters, Ph.D. and other special training in transport and planning. I have over 8 years professional experience in research and consultancy with various international organizations such as Boolomberg Global Initiative for Road Safety, where I used extensive data analytics skills to get new insight on traffic accident causes.  I am aspiring to learn, grow and share the knowledge. I started real-world data analytics while I was in the renowned Hayashi lab from the year 2009 since then I have come far and learned a lot. I am constantly looking to work on exciting projects. Now I am thrilled knowing more about Machine learning
